# Multiple-sequence-alignment
This program calculates the multiple sequence alignment of k>1 DNA sequences.

The program use the Matrix.txt file for the substitution matrix.
The matrix can be changed, and it used with default values as: 0-Match, 1-Missmatch, 2-Indel

Algorithm used for this purpose is Center Star Algotrithm
